[Declaration]

In order to build such an IDE that implement the main functions(function list, definition and context explorer, file brower), I had modified the source code of 'NERD_tree.zip 2.13.0'. You would note the comments which begin with 'Wenlong Che add/delete for trinity.vim' in the NERD_tree.vim.
